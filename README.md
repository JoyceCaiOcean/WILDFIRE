Team members: Joyce Tongxin Cai, Yogerej Visvanathan, Kwame Donkor 

## Abstract

Wildfires are becoming increasingly severe due to climate change and land-use patterns, posing serious risks to both ecosystems and communities. This study examines the **January 2025 Palisades and Eaton wildfires** in Los Angeles County, analyzing fire behavior, environmental drivers, and socioeconomic impacts using multi-source data.  

### Key Findings:  

- **<u>Fire Behavior & Environmental Drivers</u>:** The wildfire spread was **driven primarily by strong northeast winds**. **Dry vegetation**, fueled by **past wet winters**, contributed to rapid fire growth.  

- **<u>Fire Intensity & Structure Damage</u>:** Fire Radiative Power (FRP) analysis showed significant fire intensity over time. **64% of homes in Palisades** and **51% in Eaton** were **destroyed**. Structural damage was **disproportionately higher** in census tracts with **high-income and elderly populations**.  

- **<u>Air Quality Impact</u>:** The wildfire caused a **sharp increase in PM2.5 concentrations**, leading to **hazardous air quality conditions**.  

- **<u>Vegetation Loss & Recovery Potential</u>:** **Nearly 100% of burned regions had no regrowth potential**, based on **Normalized Burn Ratio Index (NBRI)** analysis.  

- **<u>Broader Implications</u>:**  Wildfire intensity, **atmospheric conditions, air pollution, and social vulnerability** are closely linked. Findings highlight the need for **improved wildfire forecasting models** and **targeted community resilience planning** to mitigate future risks.  

## Introduction

Wildfires are becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change and land-use patterns, posing serious risks to both ecosystems and human communities.  

In January 2025, the **Palisades and Eaton wildfires** in Los Angeles County collectively burned over 57,000 acres, resulting in 29 fatalities and the destruction of more than 18,000 structures. The impacts of these fires varied across different socioeconomic groups, highlighting disparities in vulnerability and resilience.  

This study analyzes the environmental and atmospheric conditions that influenced wildfire spread, with a focus on fire radiative power (FRP) data from MODIS (1-km) and VIIRS (375-m) satellites. We examine temperature patterns using ERA5 reanalysis data, alongside wind speeds, precipitation, and vegetation density, to assess their roles in fire intensity. Additionally, we evaluate the impact of wildfires on air quality and vulnerable communities by integrating land use, census tract-level socioeconomic indicators, and structure damage assessments. By understanding the relationships between atmospheric conditions, social vulnerability, and wildfire damage, this research will shed light on future mitigation strategies to reduce wildfire risks.

- Data Processing (Formatting & Cleaning): Convert all datasets to EPSG 32611 - WGS 84 / UTM zone 11N.
- **Fire Intensity Analysis** *(located in `/Fire_Incident_Analysis/`)*
  - Integrated fire radiative power (FRP) data from five satellite sources and resampled them to a daily scale for each region.  
  - Computed fire intensity based on pixel size to analyze fire spread and derived the time series of total daily radiative power.  
  - Generated a correlation heatmap to assess relationships between fire radiative power, temperature, wind speed, precipitation, and humidity, identifying key driving factors.  
  - Analyzed the correlation between fire radiative power and air pollutant concentrations (PM2.5 and PM10) to evaluate the fireâ€™s impact on air quality.  
- **Fire Structure Analysis** *(located in `/Fire_Incident_Analysis/`)*

  - Created mask to remove cloud cover pixels using SCL from Sentinel-2
  - Calculated delta NBRI from the difference between pre-fire NBRI and post-fire NBRI to determine vegetation regrowth potential in the area of study.

## Project File Structure 

* The various analyses were conducted in separate folders & notebooks and these can be identified from their names.
* For example, Land Use Land Cover and ERA5 (Weather) Analysis is done in *Land_Use_Land_Cover_ERA5_Land.ipynb* in the 'LULC_ERA5_Land' folder. 

## Limitations and Future Directions  

#### **Limitations**
- **Satellite Data Constraints**: MODIS (1-km) & VIIRS (375-m) limit fire radiative power (FRP) resolution; cloud cover/smoke obscure data.
- **Temporal Gaps**: ERA5 reanalysis (hourly) may miss sub-hourly fire dynamics; air quality stations lack dense spatial coverage.
- **Socioeconomic Data Granularity**: Census tract-level analysis may miss intra-tract disparities; lacks real-time displacement/evacuation insights.
- **Fire Behavior Model Assumptions**: FRP-based intensity lacks ember spotting, topographic effects; wind data may not capture turbulence.

#### **Future Directions**
- **Machine Learning for Fire Prediction**: Train models on historical fires, FRP, wind & land cover; use CNNs/LSTMs for forecasting.
- **High-Resolution Monitoring**: Integrate Sentinel-2 (10-30m), Landsat-9, UAV imagery for detailed vegetation & structure damage analysis.
- **Enhanced Socioeconomic & Health Analysis**: Incorporate real-time mobility, evacuation data; study long-term respiratory health impacts.
- **Interactive GIS-Based Visualization**: Develop a web dashboard with FRP, air quality & socioeconomic data using Folium/Plotly.
